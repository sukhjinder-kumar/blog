## 1. Problem Statement[^1]

You have got 100 prisoners who are allowed to strategies beforehand. One by one they will enter the room, pick 50 out of 100 boxes, and leave out the room. Once the prisoner has entered the room, they aren't allowed to talk back (think of as keeping them in separate room afterwards). Inside the boxes are the numbers 1 to 100, placed randomly amongst the 100 boxes. Each prisoner is also labelled from 1 to 100. If each prisoner finds their label amongst the 50 boxes, they all will be freed. Navielly, the probability of this happening is $$(1/2)^{100}$$, which is practically 0. Can you improve this (by a lot!)?
