## 1. Problem Statement

Determine all real numbers $$\alpha$$ such that, for every positive integer $$n$$, the integer

$$
\lfloor \alpha \rfloor + \lfloor 2\alpha \rfloor + \cdots + \lfloor n\alpha \rfloor
$$

is a multiple of $$n$$. (Note that $$\lfloor z \rfloor$$ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to $$z$$. For example, $$\lfloor -\pi \rfloor = -4$$ and $$\lfloor 2 \rfloor = \lfloor 2.9 \rfloor = 2$$.)

## 2. Solution

It is clear that $$\alpha$$ equals any even number posits a solution. For it becomes a routine sum of from $$\sum_i i(2m)$$, where we substituted $$n$$ for $$2m$$. This is equal to $$m(n)(n+1)$$, which is a clear multiple of $$n$$. The converse can be said for odd numbers. For let $$n$$ be a even number, the product is of form $$\alpha(n)(n+1)/2$$. Now niether $$\alpha$$ or $$(n+1)$$ offer the factor 2 needed for division, and so $$n$$ has to offer. However now it is surely not a multiple of $$n$$, as it has one less power of 2.

There is a little property: $$\lfloor i + \epsilon \rfloor = i + \lfloor \epsilon \rfloor$$, where $$i$$ is a integer and $$\epsilon \in (0,1)$$.
